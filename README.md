# Zone Organizer
This mod splits residential zones into additional categories:
- Low Density Residential
- Medium Density Residential
- High Density Residential
- Mixed Housing

## Requirements
- Extra Lib
- l18N Everywhere (for localization)

## Known issues
- Asset Icon Library always overwrites the zone icons when installed

## Acknowledgment
